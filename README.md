# ChatBot

*A lab report by Tony Liebel*

## Make the ChatBot your own

**Describe what changes you made to the baseline chatbot here. Don't forget to push your modified code to this repository.**

I created a chat bot for Wendy's Pi Bakery. The chatbot requested the users 3 ingredients to make a Pi, and then at the end told them their ingredients would not make a good Pi. I attempted for the ChatBot to take the indgredients and at the very end respond to the user with "I've never had a 'ingredient1, ingredient2, ingredient3,' Pi before. Sounds terrible!" But I could not figure out how to call for the first 3 inputs and put it into 1 line.


## Record someone trying out your ChatBot

**Using a phone or other video device, record someone trying out your ChatBot. Upload that video to this repository and link to it here!**
